🚀 New Project Spotlight: Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning! 🌸
Excited to share my latest project, where I explored the iconic Iris Flower Dataset to classify flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This project is a cornerstone for understanding classification tasks in machine learning, and it was a joy to bring it to life! 🌟
🔍 Project Highlights:
1. Data Exploration & Insights
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the patterns in sepal and petal dimensions across species.
Used pair plots, correlation heatmaps, and descriptive statistics to gain actionable insights into feature relationships.
2. Data Preprocessing
Preprocessed the dataset by encoding target labels and scaling features for robust model performance.
Handled missing values and ensured the data was ready for model training.
3. Model Development & Training
Implemented a Random Forest Classifier, which demonstrated excellent classification accuracy and interpretability.
Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets to validate the model’s effectiveness.
4. Performance Evaluation
Achieved high accuracy, backed by precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix to assess performance.
Visualized predictions and performance metrics to better understand model reliability.
5. New Sample Predictions
Tested the model on new, unseen measurements of Iris flowers, accurately predicting their species with confidence.
💡 Key Takeaways:
Strengthened my understanding of classification tasks and the workflow from EDA to model evaluation.
Gained hands-on experience with Random Forests, data preprocessing, and visualization techniques.
Learned the importance of scaling, encoding, and model validation in building accurate ML models.
